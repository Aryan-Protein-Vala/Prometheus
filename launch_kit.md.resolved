## Full Description (for "About" section)

### 🔥 The Problem
Your disk is full of junk you never asked for:
- **System caches** that grow forever
- **Browser bloat** eating gigabytes
- **node_modules** directories scattered everywhere
- **Old downloads** you forgot about

Most cleaners solve this by... collecting your data. Not us.

### ⚡ The Solution: Prometheus

**A beautiful terminal app that:**
- Scans your entire system in seconds
- Shows exactly what's taking space
- Lets you selectively delete what you want
- Moves files to Trash (recoverable)

**Key differentiators:**
- 🔒 **100% Offline** — Never phones home
- 🆓 **Free Forever** — No subscriptions, no upsells
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** — macOS, Windows, Linux
- 🎨 **Beautiful TUI** — Modern terminal interface
- 👨‍💻 **Developer-Focused** — Finds node_modules, .venv, cargo targets

### 📸 Screenshots to Include
1. Home screen with categories
2. Scan in progress
3. Results view with file sizes
4. Deletion confirmation

## First Comment (Maker's Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Aryan, the maker of Prometheus.

**Why I built this:**
I was tired of cleaning apps that want your email, track your usage, or upsell you constantly. I just wanted something that finds junk and deletes it. No BS.

**What makes it different:**
- It's a terminal app (I know, controversial!)
- It runs 100% offline
- It's completely free
- It moves to Trash, not permanent delete

**The tech:**
Built in Rust for speed. Uses ratatui for the TUI. Single binary, no dependencies.

**What's next:**
- Visual disk map (like DaisyDisk)
- AI-powered duplicate detection
- Scheduled cleaning

Would love your feedback! 🙏
